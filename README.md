# Angular Dashboard Project

A responsive and dynamic Angular dashboard that visualizes data through interactive charts, tables, and mock data services. The project includes a clean, user-friendly interface with a fully responsive layout, making it suitable for various screen sizes.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Sidebar and header elements adapt for mobile screens using a hamburger menu.
- **Data Visualization**: Integration of bar charts, pie charts, and tables with mock data for tracking project hours.
- **Customizable**: Easily extendable with new features like additional charts, widgets, and API data sources.
- **Mock API Data**: The data for charts and tables is mocked using Angular services, making it easy to simulate live data without a backend.
- **Angular Material Components**: Utilizes Angular Material for UI components like buttons, inputs, and date pickers.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
